# Essentials of Computer Vision  

![](assets/blurb.png)

A math-first approach to learning computer vision in Python, with the following emphasis:
- Ground-up principles, eg:  
    - Trigonometry  
    - Image Transformation  
    - Image Arithmetic  
    - Thresholding Algorithms  
    - Architectural introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Image Processing
- The `opencv` library  
- Edge Detection
- Localization  

The repository will contain all HTML, PDF, Markdown, Python Scripts, data, and media assets (images or links to supplementary videos). If you wish to contribute, I need translations for Bahasa Indonesia. Please submit a Pull Request.

The workshop that accompanies this course will also demonstrate:
- [ ] Object recognition and classification  
- [ ] Live coding a video capturing tool  
- [ ] Live coding a webcam mini-game  
- [ ] Live coding a lego-bricks counter (counting lego bricks from raw images)

## Workshops
The workshop will be delivered in English. Q&A Sessions will be in English and Bahasa Indonesia.

The intended audience for this course and accompanying workshop are absolute beginners who have an interest in computer vision and the application of artificial intelligence in object classification.
