# Background
In Chapter 4: Digit Recognition, we'll add a few new techniques to our image processing toolset by attempting to build a digit recognition pipeline from start to finish. Throughout the exercise, we will get to practice the image preprocessing tricks we've picked up from previous chapters:
- Image manipulations such as resizing, cropping, rotation, color conversion  
- Blurring and sharpening operations
- Thresholding and Edge Detection
- Contour approximation

New method and strategies that you'll be learning include:
- Drawing operations (rectangles, text) on our image  
- Region of interest and bounding rectangles
- Morphological transformations
- The Seven-Segment Display 

## What about Deep Learning?
To be clear, specialised deep learning libraries that have sprung out in recent years are a lot more robust in their approach. By utilizing machine learning principles (cost function, gradient descent etc), these specialised libraries can handle highly complex object recognition and OCR (optical character recognition) tasks at the cost of brute computing power.

The overarching motivation of this free course however, was to make clear to beginners what constitutes artificial intelligence, and to illustrate the principle benefits of machine learning. I try to achieve that by demonstrating -- over multiple chapters of this course -- how computer visions were traditionally, or rather "classically", performed prior to the emergence of deep learning. 

By learning the classical approaches to computer vision, the student (you) can compare the effort it takes to hand-tuning parameters and this adds a new dimension of appreciation towards self-learning methods that we'll discuss in the near future.

## Region of Interest
Do a quick google search on "digit recognition" and it's hard to find an introductory deep learning course that **doesn't use** the famous MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)[^1] database. This is a handwritten digit database that has long become the _de facto_ in pretty much any machine learning tutorials:

But I'd argue, that for a budding computer vision developer, your learning objectives are better served by taking a different approach. 

By choosing real life images, you are confronted with a few more key challenges that are not present from using a well-curated database such as MNIST. These challenges present new opportunities to learn about key concepts such as **region of interest**, and **morphological operations**, that you will come to rely upon greatly in the future. 

First, take a look at 4 real-life pictures of security tokens issued by banks and institutional agencies (left-to-right: Bank Central Asia, DBS, OCBC Bank, OneKey for Singapore Government e-services): 

![](assets/securitytokens.png)

Notice how noisy these images are, as each image is shot with a different background, different lighting conditions, each token is of a different size and shape, and the different colors in each security token etc. 

Your task, as a computer vision developer, is to develop a pipeline that, in each phase, take you closer to the goal. Roughly speaking, given the above task, we would formulate a pipeline that looks like the following:
1. Preprocessing, noise reduction
2. Contour approximation
3. Find region of interest (ROI), that is the area of the LED display in each of these pictures
4. Extract ROI for further preprocessing, discarding the rest of the image
5. Isolate each digit from the ROI
6. Iteratively classify each digit in the image
7. Combine the per-digit classification to a final string ("output")

In practice, step (1) and (2) above is the "application" of the methods you've learned in previous chapters of this series. As we'll soon observe, we will use a combination of blurring operations and edge detection to draw our contours. Among the contours, one of them would be the LED display containing the digits to be classified. That is our **Region of Interest**.

### Selecting Region of Interest
The GIF above demonstrates the code in `roi_01.py` but essentially it shows the `selectROI` method in action. You'll commonly combined the `selectROI` method with a either a slicing operation to crop your region of interest, or a drawing operation to call attention to the specific region of the image.

```py
x,y,w,h = cv2.selectROI("Region of interest", img)
cropped = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]
# draw rectangle 
cv2.rectangle(img_color, (x,y), (x+w,y+h), (255,0,0), 2)
```

In most cases, it simply wouldn't be realistic to render an image before manually specifying our region of interest. We'll need this operation to be as close to automatic as possible. But how exactly? That depends greatly on the specific problem set. 

In some cases, the obvious choice of strategy would be simply shape recognition, say by counting the number of vertices from each contour. The following code is an example implementation of that:

```py
# cnt = contour
peri = cv2.arcLength(cnt, True)
# contour approximation
cnt_appro = cv2.approxPolyDP(cnt, 0.03 * peri, True)
if len(cnt_approx) == 3:
    est_shape = 'triangle'
...
elif len(cnt_approx) == 5:
    est_shape = 'pentagon'
...
```

In other cases, you may employ a strategy that try to match contour based on Hu moments (which we'll study in details in future chapters). 

Other methods may involve a saliency map, or a visual attention map, for ROI extraction. These methods create a new representation of the original image where each pixel's **unique quality** are amplified or emphasized. One example implementation on Wikipedia[^2] demonstrates how straightforward this concept really is:

$$SALS(I_K) = \sum^{N}_{i=1}|I_k-I_i|$$

As you'll add new tools and strategies to your computer vision toolbox, you will pick up new approaches to ROI extraction. It is an interesting field of research that has been gaining a lot in popularity with the emergence of deep learning.

As for the images of bank security tokens, can you think of an approach that may be a good fit? Our region of interest is the LED screen at the top of the button pad on each device, and they all seem to be rather consistent in shape and size. Give it some thought and read on to find out.

### Arc Length and Area Size


### Seven-segment display
The seven-segment display (known also as "seven-segment indicator") is a form of electronic display device for displaying decimal numerals[^3] widely used in digital clocks, electronic meters, calculators and banking security tokens.
