# Kernels
When performing an arithmetic computation on a given image, one approach is to apply said computation in a neighborhood-by-neighborhood manner. This approach is very braodly termed as a **convolution**. In other words, convolution is an operation between every part of an image ("pixel neighborhood") and an operator ("kernel").

As the computation slides over each pixel neighborhood, we perform some arithmetic using the kernel, often represented as a matrix. 

This kernel describes how the pixels in that neighborhood are combined or transformed to yield a corresponding output.
