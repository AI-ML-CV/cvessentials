# Affine Transformation

## Definition
Any transformation that can be expressed in the form of a _matrix multiplication_ (linear transformation) followed by a _vector addition_ (translation). 

By the definition above, affine transformation can be used to achieve:
- Scaling (linear transformation)
- Rotations (linear transformation)
- Translations (vector additions)

We represent an Affine Transformation using a **2x3 matrix**.
